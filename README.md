🎯 Double Pendulum Simulation
This project is an interactive double pendulum simulation built using JavaScript and p5.js. The simulation visualizes the chaotic motion of a double pendulum while displaying velocity vectors for better understanding of the system's dynamics.

🚀 Features
Real-time physics simulation of a double pendulum.
Velocity vectors displayed in red for both pendulum masses.
Customizable controls:
🛑 Pause/Resume button to freeze or resume the motion.
🔄 Reset button to restart the simulation.
Smooth animations with persistent motion trails.
Inspiration: This project was inspired by Daniel Shiffman’s coding examples.
🛠️ Technologies Used
JavaScript
p5.js for graphics and animation
